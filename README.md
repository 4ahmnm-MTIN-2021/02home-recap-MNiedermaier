### Project description:

A first micro unity project to recap last year's learnings. 

The project has three Scenes. Each scene contains a button to switch to the next scene. 

All scenes have to be setup screen independently with a resolution of 960x600. 
The first scene contains a welcome text "Hello winter semester 2020/21" and a button with "Next" as text. 
The second scene contains also a text "Press space key to change the colour" and an image with the default color red. 
Every time the user hits the space key the color changes in random order between the colors: 
Red, blue, green, Magenta.
The third scene shows a text "Add Numbers", two input fields for numbers, more text objects "+", "=", "result", which displays the result 
of the calculation number "input field 1" + number "input field 2" = result, when the button Add is pressed. 
The next button isn't working in this first version of the project.
